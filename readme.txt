## 📌 Overview

This project builds a **needs-first recommendation system** for retail banking clients using interpretable machine learning. Instead of starting from financial products, we identify individual client needs — *Income vs Accumulation* — and match suitable products from a catalog using a transparent, explainable model.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect client investment needs (Income / Accumulation) based on demographic and financial data.
- Use interpretable decision trees to ensure explainability.
- Recommend a suitable product that adheres to client-specific risk tolerances.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Data

- **Rows:** 5000 anonymized retail bank clients  
- **Features:**  
  - Age, Gender, FamilyMembers, FinancialEducation, RiskPropensity, Income, Wealth  
- **Targets:**  
  - Binary flags: `IncomeInvestment`, `AccumulationInvestment`

### 2. Feature Engineering

- `Gender x Age` → life-stage modeling  
- `log(Income / Wealth)` → liquidity vs capital insight  
- Log-transform + MinMax scaling for skewed data  

### 3. Model

- Two separate **Decision Trees (depth=5)** for the two need targets  
- **5-fold cross-validation**  
- F1 score used as primary evaluation metric

### 4. Recommendation Logic (NBA)

- Predict each client’s needs
- Filter product catalog by need type
- Enforce risk suitability: `ProductRisk ≤ ClientRiskPropensity`
- Recommend the **highest-risk suitable product**
